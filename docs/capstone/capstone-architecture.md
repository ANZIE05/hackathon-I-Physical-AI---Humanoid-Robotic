# Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid Architecture

This capstone project integrates all concepts learned throughout the course into a comprehensive autonomous humanoid robot system. The project demonstrates the integration of ROS 2, simulation, AI perception, and multimodal interaction.

## Learning Objectives

- Integrate all course concepts into a unified system
- Design an architecture for autonomous humanoid operation
- Implement human-robot interaction with conversational AI
- Validate the complete system in simulation

## Key Concepts

The capstone project represents the culmination of the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics course, bringing together:

### System Integration

The capstone requires integrating all components learned in the course:
- ROS 2 communication and control systems
- Gazebo/Isaac Sim for simulation and testing
- Perception systems for environment understanding
- VLA systems for multimodal interaction
- Navigation and planning for autonomous operation

### Humanoid-Specific Challenges

Humanoid robots present unique challenges that must be addressed:
- Balance and locomotion control
- Complex kinematics and dynamics
- Human-like interaction modalities
- Safety considerations for human environments

### Conversational AI Integration

The system must incorporate natural language processing for human interaction, requiring:
- Speech recognition and understanding
- Natural language generation
- Context-aware dialogue management
- Integration with robotic action systems

## Project Requirements

The autonomous humanoid system must demonstrate:
- Navigation in complex environments
- Object recognition and manipulation
- Natural language interaction
- Safe operation in human environments
- Integration of perception and action systems
