# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This course bridges the gap between digital AI (models, agents, LLMs) and physical embodiment (robots, sensors, actuators), preparing you for the future of embodied intelligence.

## About This Textbook

This textbook is designed for AI students with intermediate Python knowledge who want to learn about Physical AI and humanoid robotics. It follows a simulation-first learning approach, with practical exercises using ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action systems.

### Course Structure

The curriculum is organized into 4 core learning modules over a 13-week progression:

1. **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Foundational concepts of robotic communication and control
2. **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Simulation environments and physics modeling
3. **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - Perception, planning, and control systems
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Multimodal AI integration

Each module includes concept explanations, practical labs, and review questions to ensure comprehensive learning.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this course, you will be able to:

- Design and implement robotic systems using ROS 2
- Create and simulate robotic environments with Gazebo
- Implement AI perception and control systems with NVIDIA Isaac
- Integrate vision, language, and action systems
- Develop autonomous humanoid robot capabilities
- Understand simulation-to-real transfer principles

## Prerequisites

- Intermediate Python programming skills
- Basic understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Basic knowledge of machine learning concepts

## How to Use This Textbook

This textbook is structured for progressive learning. We recommend following the modules in sequence, completing all practical exercises, and engaging with the review questions. The content is designed to be self-contained but builds upon previous concepts.

Throughout the textbook, you'll find:
- **Learning Objectives** at the beginning of each section
- **Practical Labs** with step-by-step instructions
- **Review Questions** to test your understanding
- **Key Concepts** highlighted for important information


## Hardware & Lab Architecture

This course includes guidance on setting up appropriate learning environments with:
- Workstation requirements (RTX systems)
- Edge AI kits (Jetson Orin)
- Sensor stacks (cameras, IMUs, microphones)
- Robot options (proxy, humanoid, premium)

The curriculum emphasizes simulation-to-real pipeline concepts, including digital twin concepts, sim-to-real transfer, edge deployment constraints, and latency considerations.

## Assessment Projects

The course includes multiple assessment projects:
- ROS 2 package project
- Gazebo simulation project
- Isaac-based perception pipeline
- Final capstone: Autonomous humanoid with conversational AI

Let's begin our journey into the fascinating world of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics!
